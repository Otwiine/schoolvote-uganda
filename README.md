# School Vote Uganda

**School Vote Uganda** is a simple and secure web-based voting system designed specifically for schools in Uganda. The goal is to make student elections more transparent, easier to manage, and resistant to cheating.

## Why This Project?

Many schools in Uganda still use **paper-based voting**, which is often:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to human error
- Vulnerable to manipulation or vote tampering

**School Vote Uganda** aims to fix that by providing a **digital solution** that:
- Is easy for teachers and students to use
- Works on both desktop and mobile
- Can track results in real-time
- Helps promote fair democratic processes in schools
