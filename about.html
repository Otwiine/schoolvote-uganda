      <h1>About School Vote Uganda</h1>
<p>
  <strong>School Vote Uganda</strong> is a platform built to ensure school elections across Uganda are fair, transparent, and secure. We provide each school with a dedicated voting space where students can view candidates and vote using a unique ID issued by their school.
</p>

<p>
  This student-driven initiative was created by <strong>Otwiine & Lui</strong> to bring modern, secure, and transparent elections to secondary schools across Uganda.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>
  Like many students, we saw first-hand how paper ballots and manual counting can slow elections, invite errors, and drain excitement. We decided to build a digital platform that lets every learner cast a vote in seconds—no long queues, no questionable tallies, no lost ballots.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What We Stand For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> One student, one vote—securely logged and unalterable.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Live vote-count dashboards for teachers and candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Mobile-friendly interface that works even on slow data.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Secure Log-In linked to class registers or student IDs.</li>
  <li>Encrypted Ballots to prevent tampering and duplicate votes.</li>
  <li>Real-Time Results viewable by authorized staff the moment polls close.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Why Public</h2>
<p>
  Our code is visible on GitHub so educators and developers can examine how it works—but all rights are reserved. No one may legally reuse or rebrand the platform without our written consent, safeguarding the integrity of Ugandan school elections.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
  We’re continuously refining SchoolVote Uganda through user feedback and new security audits. Future plans include multilingual interfaces (Luganda, Swahili).
</p>
